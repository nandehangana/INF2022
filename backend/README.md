# Group II Financial Systems Design Dashboard

## Prerequisites

#### Installing Python

Make sure that you have [Python installed](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) on your machine.

You might want to use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) standard Python library
to create virtual environments and have Python, `pip` and all dependent packages to be installed and 
served from the local project directory to avoid messing with system wide packages and their 
versions.

#### Installing Dependencies

Install all dependencies that are required for the project by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
